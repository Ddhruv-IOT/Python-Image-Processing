# Image Augmentation in python 

## Overview
<br/>Image augmentation is a technique that is used to artificially expand the data-set. 
<br/>This is helpful when we are given a data-set with very few data samples

## Working:
- Here, I have used Keras ImageDataGenerator to perform Image Augmentation
- Image data generator has to many factors that can be changed to get different images from the provided image.
- some of them are:
  - rotation_range
  - width_shift_range
  - height_shift_range
  - brightness_range
  - shear_range
  - zoom_range            
  - fill_mode
  - horizontal_flip
  - cval
  - rescale
