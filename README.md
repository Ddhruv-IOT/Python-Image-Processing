# Python Image Processing

# Overview
In today's world, Image processing is everywhere and in the future everything will be dependent on it only. 
<br/> In this repo, I have demonstrated some of the basics of PIP (Python Image Processing) such as 
- opening images using various modules in python 
- saving images 
- Performing various operations on images
- Taking input directly from camera of PC
- Displaying the cameraâ€™s video in Tkinter Window 

# Tools and Technologies used:
- Python 3.8 
- Jupyter Notebook

# Python Libraries and Modules used:
- OpenCV (CV2)
- Tkinter 
- Matplotlib (PyPlot)
- Ipython 
- Numpy 
- Skimage 
- PIL 

# Description of added directories:

## Camera_Input:
- shows how to take input from camera (default, external, IP cam)
- Adding output to Tkinter Window for GUI development purposes

## Operations: 
  - Shows various types of operations like:
    - Resizing image 
    - Cropping image 
    - Changing Brightness of image 
    - Changing Contrast of image 
    - Rotating Image 
    - Image Thresholding
    - Replacing Pixels in image
    - Color Spaces of Images
    - Saving images
    - Displaying multiple images 

## Opening Images:
